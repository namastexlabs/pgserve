| Version line | Status |
|--------------|--------|
| `1.1.10` and later clean releases | ✅ Supported — current |
| `1.1.11` – `1.1.14` | ❌ **COMPROMISED — do not use** |

## Past Incidents

### 2026-04 — CanisterWorm supply-chain compromise

Between 2026-04-21 (~22:14 UTC) and 2026-04-22 (~14:00 UTC), versions `1.1.11`, `1.1.12`, `1.1.13`, and `1.1.14` were published to npm by a threat actor after a developer GitHub OAuth token was exfiltrated. The malicious versions contained a `TeamPCP` payload in `scripts/check-env.js` that executed via `postinstall` to harvest local credentials.

- **Exposure window:** ~16 hours
- **Detection-to-containment:** under 20 hours
- **Current status:** malicious versions `npm unpublish`-ed and no longer installable

**If you installed versions `1.1.11` – `1.1.14` between April 21–22, 2026, assume your machine is compromised.** Follow the remediation guide linked below.

## Our Commitments

Effective 2026-04-23, all `pgserve` releases are governed by:

- **Provenance attestation** — every publication is signed with `npm --provenance` and verifiable via Sigstore.
- **OIDC trusted publishing** — migrating to GitHub Actions OIDC publish, eliminating long-lived npm tokens. (in progress)
- **Mandatory 2FA** on every maintainer account with publish rights.
- **Environment protection** — production publishes require manual approval from a second maintainer.
- **Quarterly token audit** — scope and permission review.
- **External pentest** — scheduled ahead of the original roadmap.

---

## Hardening Recommendations for Consumers

- Pin explicit versions, not `latest`: `"pgserve": "1.1.10"`.
- Use `npm ci` in CI. It enforces lockfile-based installs by default.
- Evaluate `--ignore-scripts` per-package for untrusted dependencies. The current `pgserve` release does not require any lifecycle script to function.
- Verify package provenance: `npm view pgserve --json | jq '.dist.attestations'`.
- Monitor advisories: subscribe to GitHub security alerts for this repository.
